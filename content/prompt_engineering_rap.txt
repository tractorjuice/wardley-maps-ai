(Verse 1)
Yo, we got a story 'bout a Wardley Map,
Prompt Engineering, puttin' AI on the map,
Components in place, relationships tight,
Gonna rock this rap with rhythm all night.

(Chorus)
Hey, listen up, we're droppin' this beat,
With Prompt Techniques that can't be beat,
An AI symphony up in the cloud,
Together we'll make the future so proud.

(Verse 2)
LLMs, LLaMA, Alpaca, and Dolly,
Makin' waves, AI party, no folly,
Text splitters, chunkers, embeddings in flow,
Creating a rhythm, watch us go.

(Bridge)
Vector DBs, Supabase too,
Metadata and tools, we're coming through,
Pinecone, Zapier, Chroma mixin' it up,
A tech rap revolution, can't get enough.

(Verse 3)
Custom agents, chains, and tunin',
Progress all around, ain't no ruin',
ANN algorithms, kNN, Faiss,
In this AI rap game, they got a place.

(Chorus)
Hey, listen up, we're droppin' this beat,
With Prompt Techniques that can't be beat,
An AI symphony up in the cloud,
Together we'll make the future so proud.

(Bridge)
In the world of AI, we innovate,
With a Wardley Map, we navigate,
A new era of tech, we'll orchestrate,
Sing along, join the AI crusade.

(Outro)
This rap 'bout the map, it's our anthem,
A tribute to tech, a new kingdom,
Prompt Engineering, a story to tell,
In the world of AI, we will excel.
