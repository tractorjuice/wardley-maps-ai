Speaker: Hi there and welcome back to our channel where we discuss the latest trends and innovations in the world of technology. Today, we're going to take a closer look at a Wardley Map on Prompt Engineering.

[Cut to a screen showing the Wardley Map]

Speaker: As you can see, this Wardley Map is quite complex, but don't worry, we're going to break it down and focus on the most important components.

[Zoom in on the components labeled "Prompt Templates"]

Speaker: One of the key components on this map is the "Prompt Templates." These templates are designed to help generate prompts for conversational agents, making it easier to create conversational AI applications. With these templates, developers can quickly build and test their conversational models.

[Zoom in on the components labeled "Agents"]

Speaker: Another important component on this map is "Agents." These are software programs that perform specific tasks in the conversational AI system. They can help with tasks such as text analysis, data processing, and answering questions.

[Zoom in on the components labeled "Tools"]

Speaker: "Tools" is another critical component on this Wardley Map. These tools are essential for building and managing conversational AI systems. They include tools for text analysis, data storage, and data processing.

[Zoom in on the components labeled "LLMs"]

Speaker: "LLMs" are another critical component on this map. LLMs stands for "Large Language Models" which are models that have been trained on massive amounts of data and can generate high-quality responses to complex questions.

[Zoom in on the components labeled "Compute"]

Speaker: "Compute" is another essential component on this Wardley Map. This refers to the computing resources needed to run the conversational AI system. This includes hardware such as servers and cloud computing resources.

[Zoom in on the components labeled "DataOps"]

Speaker: Finally, we have "DataOps." This component is responsible for managing the data used in the conversational AI system. This includes tasks such as data cleaning, data storage, and data analysis.

[Cut back to the speaker at the desk]

Speaker: So there you have it, a quick overview of some of the most important components on this Wardley Map for Prompt Engineering. It's important to note that these components are all interconnected, and each one plays a critical role in the development and management of conversational AI systems.
