Create a beginner-level exam on Wardley Mapping, a technique for strategic planning used to understand the landscape of a business or organization. The exam should cover the basics of Wardley Mapping, including its concept, principles, and application, based on the book "Wardley Mapping: The Knowledge - Part One: Topographical Intelligence in Business" by Simon Wardley. The exam should consist of 10 multiple-choice questions that evaluate the examinee's knowledge and understanding of the technique. The examinee should be given 60 minutes to complete the exam.

Rating: 9/10. The prompt is now well-defined, specific, and includes all the necessary details to create the exam. The only suggestion would be to provide a clear explanation of the topics or concepts that the multiple-choice questions should cover.

Suggestions:

Specify the topics or concepts that the multiple-choice questions should cover, such as the stages of evolution, the components of a Wardley Map, and the application of the technique in various industries.
Consider adding some visual questions, such as asking the examinee to identify the components of a Wardley Map or the relationships between the components.
Provide a clear explanation of the grading rubric for the multiple-choice questions, to ensure that the grading is fair and consistent.
